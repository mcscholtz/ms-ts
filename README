A simple co-operative operating system for the dsPIC33 micro controller from microchip. It includes a simple FIFO scheduler and a memory pool allocator. It is written in less than a 1000 lines of code and complies to just under 4KB's using microchip's C30 compiler. The memory pool can also be tweaked depending on how much memory you have.

Will add more information on how to use it later
